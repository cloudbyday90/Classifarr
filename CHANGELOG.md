## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Tested local Ollama verification** — AI Settings can now run a bounded, media-free JSON-Schema capability test for the saved primary Ollama configuration, present its current state, and admit only current successful results to candidate-bound verification.
- **Ollama runtime mismatch monitoring** — Classifarr now counts bounded strict-verification model-digest mismatches and records their last-observed time without storing provider text, media data, prompts, responses, or digests.
- **Ollama runtime operations panel** — AI Settings now provides an administrator-only, cached aggregate view of strict-Ollama digest mismatch count and last-observed time, without exposing model identity, endpoint details, errors, or event history.
- **Model-change remediation guidance** — When strict Ollama verification is invalidated by a model change, AI Settings now presents a contextual, administrator-initiated re-test of the saved configuration with aggregate-only runtime context.
- **Queue admission diagnostics** — The Command Center now separately explains unavailable classification-worker capacity and a saved Ollama model change that blocks only strict candidate verification, with an explicit path to AI Settings.
- **Queue decision-path telemetry** — When classification work is waiting, the Command Center now shows a cached, aggregate-only 24-hour summary of deterministic policy routes, AI attempts, AI-unavailable retries, and strict-verification abstentions.
- **Queue telemetry operational acceptance** — The integration suite now verifies the real queue telemetry path with transaction-scoped synthetic decision records that are always rolled back.
- **Queue telemetry HTTP acceptance** — The live-stats route now has transaction-scoped acceptance coverage that rejects unauthenticated requests before the queue service runs and confirms the authenticated response remains aggregate-only.

### Fixed

- **Ollama verification fidelity** — Ollama generation now sends decoding controls in the documented runtime-options object, and AI Settings preserves and clearly reports completed-but-ineligible strict-verification results instead of showing them as untested or generically successful.
- **Ollama strict-output delivery** — Streamed Ollama generation now forwards strict response schemas and verifies the tested model digest before candidate-bound verification runs.
- **Ollama verification recovery** — A model digest mismatch now revokes only the matching saved strict-verification capability, explains the required re-test in AI Settings, and recognizes a current tested primary Ollama path in remediation readiness.
- **CI validation** — Removed an unused runtime-summary singleton that caused the server Knip quality gate and its dependent release-acceptance readout to fail.
- **Schema snapshot validation** — Regenerated the authoritative PostgreSQL 18 schema snapshot so container validation remains stable after the PostgreSQL 18.6 image update.

### Security

- **Local verification fail-closed controls** — Strict Ollama authority is bound to an explicit administrator test, current configuration fingerprint/revision, model digest, timeout-bounded preflight, and existing server-side candidate confirmation rules; fallbacks remain advisory.
- **Runtime re-tag containment** — A stale worker cannot invalidate a newer save or verification test, and a mismatch remains blocked even if runtime telemetry persistence is unavailable.
- **Runtime-observability access boundary** — The mismatch panel uses server-side administrator authorization, a dedicated post-authentication limiter, a parameterized fixed-dimension query, and an allow-listed response with no client-selected dimensions.
- **Manual remediation boundary** — Model-change recovery requires an administrator’s explicit existing test action; it neither retries automatically nor re-admits strict verification before a successful test.
- **Queue diagnostic privacy boundary** — Queue status exposes only fixed worker and strict-verification state IDs; it does not reveal provider configuration, model identity, digests, raw errors, media, or policy data.
- **Decision-path telemetry boundary** — Queue telemetry reads four fixed aggregate counters from existing history, is skipped without queued classifications, and never returns item, library, policy, provider, model, prompt, response, error, or decision identifiers.

### Changed

- **Client tooling** — Applied the locally tested dependency changes from open PR #520 (`@types/node`, ESLint, and `vue-tsc`); the pull request was not merged and no release was created.
- **Security automation** — Applied the locally tested pinned CodeQL Action update from open PR #518; the pull request was not merged and no release was created.

## [v0.48.3-beta] - 2026-08-28

### Changed

- **Second-pass candidate verification** — An adopted policy-recheck confirmation candidate now enters the same strict, candidate-bound AI verification admission path as a first-pass confirmation, while the policy engine remains the routing authority.
- **Client tooling** — Applied the Vite 8.2.2 development-dependency update from open PR #519 locally; no pull request was merged and no release was created.
- **Compatibility-policy maintenance** — Existing compatibility policies now provide a direct maintenance review action, and administrators can explicitly add a bounded library-profile purpose suggestion to an unsaved policy draft before normal review and save.
- **Release hygiene** — The product-language audit now recognizes the required fresh, empty `Unreleased` changelog section after a release is cut.

### Fixed

- **Policy recheck review safety** — AI-call budgets, resilience gates, and provider failures now retain the deterministic confirmation candidate for operator review rather than replacing it with an unrelated baseline result.

### Security

- **Verification boundary consistency** — Rechecked confirmation candidates use server-owned candidate binding, provider admission before generation, and bounded status-only outcomes.

## [v0.48.2-beta] - 2026-08-22

Detailed engineering history is retained in the [August 2026 release archive](docs/changelog/CHANGELOG-2026-08-releases.md).

### Added

- **Release evidence and provider-fault gates** — Tag publication now verifies bounded evidence provenance and a disposable provider-fault recovery receipt before publishing images or a GitHub release.
- **Local AI evaluation contract** — Reviewed fixtures, policy-context fingerprints, decision witnesses, and aggregate trend comparison make local classification evaluation reproducible without exposing raw local data.
- **Bounded policy maintenance** — Administrators can review purpose coverage, remediate unresolved policies, and safely resume an interrupted native-purpose change through narrow, receipt-backed controls.
- **Release and image assurance** — Added immutable image consumer smoke, release-attestation verification, installation-evidence assembly, and manifest-aware retention assessment.

### Changed

- **Policy-route delivery** — Split authoring, maintenance, and insight pages into independent production bundles and added a Chromium cold-load budget gate for every policy route.
- **Release metadata contract** — Package and lockfile versions, the UI label, README marker and badge, and top release-note heading now share a deterministic pre-tag validation.
- **AI evaluation access** — Local sweeps exchange narrowly scoped, short-lived tokens and preserve policy authority through direct and queued decision evaluation.
- **Toolchain maintenance** — Applied reviewed client/server dependency and pinned-workflow updates while retaining ESM, lint, test, coverage, and security gates.

### Fixed

- **Provider recovery safety** — Transient provider failures persist as retryable, no-route work rather than an unsafe destination decision.
- **Evaluation correctness** — Fixed scoped-route matching, API-key authentication, queued non-final grading, and temporary AI-settings ETag handling.
- **Policy and restore reliability** — Corrected native-purpose audit persistence, pending-decision replacement, backup/restore history protection, and schema-snapshot comparison noise.
- **Client test stability** — Isolated router initialization and bounded Vitest workers for reliable constrained-host test execution.

### Security

- **Policy and provider boundaries** — Preserved server-owned route authority, capability-gated AI verification, bounded recovery data, and explicit no-route behavior under provider failure.
- **Supply-chain verification** — Enforced provenance checks for release evidence and multi-architecture images before release publication.
- **Dependency remediation** — Updated audited client, server, and workflow dependencies, including current OSV and CodeQL action pins.
