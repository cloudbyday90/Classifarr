## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Bounded candidate adjudication** — Ambiguous policy selections can now receive an AI advisory comparison of two or three server-selected eligible destinations, using observed library-profile and relevant historical evidence while retaining operator confirmation.
- **Current-library candidate retrieval** — Candidate adjudication now uses a bounded read-only lookup over the synchronized current library inventory, recognizing exact identifiers, title/year, and plain-text catalog matches without changing routing authority.

### Changed

- **AI evidence minimization** — Candidate adjudication sends bounded profile distributions and limited historical titles only to a syntactically trusted local Ollama endpoint; all other providers and hosts receive aggregate availability, size-band, and match facts.
- **Catalog evidence minimization** — Current-library lookup sends at most three title/year matches per candidate only to a syntactically trusted local Ollama endpoint; other providers receive aggregate retrieval facts only.
- **Comparison coverage precision** — Destination competition now distinguishes complete active-competitor coverage from a genuinely capped comparison, including the exact-cap case, without exposing an active-policy total or identity.
- **Shared-eligibility explanation** — Destination competition now explains possible overlap through allow-listed, anonymous declared-purpose category aggregates without exposing policy terms or changing routing authority.
- **Destination competition preview** — Existing-policy maintenance can now compare a proposed draft against bounded, anonymous active same-media-type competitors and report aggregate deterministic eligibility overlap before saving.
- **Policy cohort preview** — Existing-policy maintenance can now compare a saved policy and unsaved draft against a bounded recent deterministic cohort, returning aggregate native-eligibility deltas before the draft is saved.
- **Policy overlap precision** — Current-policy coverage and draft preflight now flag a shared `require_any` purpose alternative even when a sibling term is unique, preventing broad fallback matches from being presented as safely distinct.

### Security

- **Adjudication authority boundary** — The server validates every proposal against the original policy-owned candidate set, discards model reasoning and confidence, persists only allow-listed status facts, and always keeps routing behind the operator decision.
- **Ollama endpoint trust boundary** — Detailed candidate profiles and historical titles now require a syntax-validated trusted-local endpoint; an arbitrary DNS name or public address receives aggregate-only evidence.
- **Current-library retrieval boundary** — Candidate-owned library IDs, media type, and result caps are fixed server-side; descriptions are never returned from the read-only query, unexpected library rows are discarded, and retrieval failure remains advisory and unavailable.
- **Retrieved-text containment** — Catalog title evidence is normalized to a bounded single line and retrieval labels are allow-listed before prompt construction, limiting prompt-shaped media metadata.

- **Comparison-cap privacy boundary** — Coverage detection uses one server-only sentinel to identify omitted competitors; the sentinel, total active-policy count, configurations, identities, and routing authority remain unavailable to clients.
- **Explanation privacy boundary** — Shared-eligibility explanations expose only allow-listed category labels and anonymous configuration counts after a bounded shared result; they never return rule values, competitor identities, item outcomes, AI state, or routing control.
- **Competition-preview privacy and resource boundary** — The administrator-only competition preview derives competitors and fixed caps server-side, uses batched native-intent reads and parameterized SQL, returns no competitor or media identity, and cannot call AI, persist, learn, or route media.
- **Cohort-preview privacy and authority boundary** — The administrator-only simulation accepts only a validated draft, derives scope and fixed bounds server-side, uses a parameterized read-only query, returns aggregate counts only, and cannot call AI, persist a draft, learn, or route media.
- **Policy-review data boundary** — Disjunctive-overlap guidance remains administrator-only and aggregate-only: it returns counts and fixed guidance without exposing policy terms, draft contents, media data, AI output, or routing controls.

## [v0.48.4-beta] - 2026-08-29

### Added

- **Saved-model matrix coverage** — The Ollama compatibility matrix now explicitly states whether the saved primary model was among eligible locally installed models, with safe next-step guidance that does not expose provider configuration or change strict-verification authority.
- **Ollama compatibility matrix** — AI Settings can now run a bounded, serial, media-free strict-output check across up to six server-discovered local Ollama model builds, returning only advisory allow-listed results for the current response.
- **Ollama verification test history** — AI Settings now presents a fixed 30-day aggregate of saved Ollama verification-test outcomes, distinguishing intermittent results from recurring strict-output or availability failures without retaining configuration or test content.
- **Tested local Ollama verification** — AI Settings can now run a bounded, media-free JSON-Schema capability test for the saved primary Ollama configuration, present its current state, and admit only current successful results to candidate-bound verification.
- **Ollama runtime mismatch monitoring** — Classifarr now counts bounded strict-verification model-digest mismatches and records their last-observed time without storing provider text, media data, prompts, responses, or digests.
- **Ollama runtime operations panel** — AI Settings now provides an administrator-only, cached aggregate view of strict-Ollama digest mismatch count and last-observed time, without exposing model identity, endpoint details, errors, or event history.
- **Model-change remediation guidance** — When strict Ollama verification is invalidated by a model change, AI Settings now presents a contextual, administrator-initiated re-test of the saved configuration with aggregate-only runtime context.
- **Queue admission diagnostics** — The Command Center now separately explains unavailable classification-worker capacity and a saved Ollama model change that blocks only strict candidate verification, with an explicit path to AI Settings.
- **Queue decision-path telemetry** — When classification work is waiting, the Command Center now shows a cached, aggregate-only 24-hour summary of deterministic policy routes, AI attempts, AI-unavailable retries, and strict-verification abstentions.
- **Queue telemetry operational acceptance** — The integration suite now verifies the real queue telemetry path with transaction-scoped synthetic decision records that are always rolled back.
- **Queue telemetry HTTP acceptance** — The live-stats route now has transaction-scoped acceptance coverage that rejects unauthenticated requests before the queue service runs and confirms the authenticated response remains aggregate-only.

### Fixed

- **One-step Ollama verification** — Saving a changed primary Ollama target now automatically runs its bounded strict-verification test, visibly separates an unsaved selection from saved capability, and removes the redundant second save confirmation.
- **Qwen strict verification** — Fixed the documented top-level Ollama `think: false` control for bounded strict JSON-schema probes, allowing reasoning-model verification results to be validated from the response channel without changing normal classification behavior.
- **Ollama matrix type safety** — The server typecheck now validates the compatibility matrix's saved-configuration, probe, selection, and report contracts before CI can publish a release candidate.
- **Ollama matrix capacity selection** — Compatibility checks now keep the explicitly saved model but skip oversized, unknown-size, and clearly embedding-only alternative models before they can consume local inference resources; AI Settings shows only an aggregate skipped count.
- **Ollama verification fidelity** — Ollama generation now sends decoding controls in the documented runtime-options object, and AI Settings preserves and clearly reports completed-but-ineligible strict-verification results instead of showing them as untested or generically successful.
- **Ollama strict-output delivery** — Streamed Ollama generation now forwards strict response schemas and verifies the tested model digest before candidate-bound verification runs.
- **Ollama verification recovery** — A model digest mismatch now revokes only the matching saved strict-verification capability, explains the required re-test in AI Settings, and recognizes a current tested primary Ollama path in remediation readiness.
- **CI validation** — Removed an unused runtime-summary singleton that caused the server Knip quality gate and its dependent release-acceptance readout to fail.
- **Schema snapshot validation** — Regenerated the authoritative PostgreSQL 18 schema snapshot so container validation remains stable after the PostgreSQL 18.6 image update.

### Security

- **Ollama matrix capacity boundary** — Alternative probes now require a server-discovered, bounded artifact size and reject clear embedding indicators; no model-size, family, target, or provider output is returned to the browser.
- **Saved-model coverage privacy** — Matrix configuration coverage is an independently allow-listed boolean with no returned host, configured model name, prompt, raw provider output, or automatic configuration change.
- **Ollama matrix resource boundary** — The manual compatibility matrix accepts no browser-selected provider target or model list, excludes cloud-tagged models, caps and serializes probes, requests model unload, rate-limits administrator actions, rejects concurrent runs, and neither persists output nor changes strict-verification authority.
- **Ollama history privacy boundary** — Saved-test trend data is limited to three fixed daily counters and timestamps, pruned after 30 days, served through a parameter-free administrator-only rate-limited endpoint, and never affects capability authority or routing.
- **Local verification fail-closed controls** — Strict Ollama authority is bound to an explicit administrator test, current configuration fingerprint/revision, model digest, timeout-bounded preflight, and existing server-side candidate confirmation rules; fallbacks remain advisory.
- **Runtime re-tag containment** — A stale worker cannot invalidate a newer save or verification test, and a mismatch remains blocked even if runtime telemetry persistence is unavailable.
- **Runtime-observability access boundary** — The mismatch panel uses server-side administrator authorization, a dedicated post-authentication limiter, a parameterized fixed-dimension query, and an allow-listed response with no client-selected dimensions.
- **Ollama verification action boundary** — An administrator save of a changed primary target runs exactly one existing saved-target test; out-of-band runtime drift remains manually re-testable, and no path re-admits strict verification before a successful test.
- **Queue diagnostic privacy boundary** — Queue status exposes only fixed worker and strict-verification state IDs; it does not reveal provider configuration, model identity, digests, raw errors, media, or policy data.
- **Decision-path telemetry boundary** — Queue telemetry reads four fixed aggregate counters from existing history, is skipped without queued classifications, and never returns item, library, policy, provider, model, prompt, response, error, or decision identifiers.

### Changed

- **Ollama remediation guidance** — Added a safe, manual runbook for resolving compatibility-matrix outcomes through local inspection and explicit re-testing, without automatic pulls, deletions, provider targeting, or settings changes.
- **Client tooling** — Applied the locally tested dependency changes from open PR #520 (`@types/node`, ESLint, and `vue-tsc`); the pull request was not merged and no release was created.
- **Security automation** — Applied the locally tested pinned CodeQL Action update from open PR #518; the pull request was not merged and no release was created.

## [v0.48.3-beta] - 2026-08-28

### Changed

- **Second-pass candidate verification** — An adopted policy-recheck confirmation candidate now enters the same strict, candidate-bound AI verification admission path as a first-pass confirmation, while the policy engine remains the routing authority.
- **Client tooling** — Applied the Vite 8.2.2 development-dependency update from open PR #519 locally; no pull request was merged and no release was created.
- **Compatibility-policy maintenance** — Existing compatibility policies now provide a direct maintenance review action, and administrators can explicitly add a bounded library-profile purpose suggestion to an unsaved policy draft before normal review and save.
- **Release hygiene** — The product-language audit now recognizes the required fresh, empty `Unreleased` changelog section after a release is cut.

### Fixed

- **Policy recheck review safety** — AI-call budgets, resilience gates, and provider failures now retain the deterministic confirmation candidate for operator review rather than replacing it with an unrelated baseline result.

### Security

- **Verification boundary consistency** — Rechecked confirmation candidates use server-owned candidate binding, provider admission before generation, and bounded status-only outcomes.

## [v0.48.2-beta] - 2026-08-22

Detailed engineering history is retained in the [August 2026 release archive](docs/changelog/CHANGELOG-2026-08-releases.md).

### Added

- **Release evidence and provider-fault gates** — Tag publication now verifies bounded evidence provenance and a disposable provider-fault recovery receipt before publishing images or a GitHub release.
- **Local AI evaluation contract** — Reviewed fixtures, policy-context fingerprints, decision witnesses, and aggregate trend comparison make local classification evaluation reproducible without exposing raw local data.
- **Bounded policy maintenance** — Administrators can review purpose coverage, remediate unresolved policies, and safely resume an interrupted native-purpose change through narrow, receipt-backed controls.
- **Release and image assurance** — Added immutable image consumer smoke, release-attestation verification, installation-evidence assembly, and manifest-aware retention assessment.

### Changed

- **Policy-route delivery** — Split authoring, maintenance, and insight pages into independent production bundles and added a Chromium cold-load budget gate for every policy route.
- **Release metadata contract** — Package and lockfile versions, the UI label, README marker and badge, and top release-note heading now share a deterministic pre-tag validation.
- **AI evaluation access** — Local sweeps exchange narrowly scoped, short-lived tokens and preserve policy authority through direct and queued decision evaluation.
- **Toolchain maintenance** — Applied reviewed client/server dependency and pinned-workflow updates while retaining ESM, lint, test, coverage, and security gates.

### Fixed

- **Provider recovery safety** — Transient provider failures persist as retryable, no-route work rather than an unsafe destination decision.
- **Evaluation correctness** — Fixed scoped-route matching, API-key authentication, queued non-final grading, and temporary AI-settings ETag handling.
- **Policy and restore reliability** — Corrected native-purpose audit persistence, pending-decision replacement, backup/restore history protection, and schema-snapshot comparison noise.
- **Client test stability** — Isolated router initialization and bounded Vitest workers for reliable constrained-host test execution.

### Security

- **Policy and provider boundaries** — Preserved server-owned route authority, capability-gated AI verification, bounded recovery data, and explicit no-route behavior under provider failure.
- **Supply-chain verification** — Enforced provenance checks for release evidence and multi-architecture images before release publication.
- **Dependency remediation** — Updated audited client, server, and workflow dependencies, including current OSV and CodeQL action pins.
