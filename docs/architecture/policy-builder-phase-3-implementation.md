# Policy Builder Phase 3 Implementation

Status: in progress
Scope: intent-first builder presentation, legacy-compatible save contract

## Goal

Phase 3 makes the policy builder read as an intent-first workflow after the
Phase 2 draft bridge exists. The builder should explain policy behavior before
it exposes starter-template mechanics.

This phase does not change database storage, API payloads, or classification
scoring. It uses the draft model as the source for product-facing presentation
and keeps the legacy preset-backed `customSignals` serializer in place.

## First Implemented Component

The first implemented component adds a read-only policy behavior summary:

1. Add `client/src/utils/policyIntentSummary.js` as a pure summary builder.
2. Derive Purpose, Hard Limits, Helpful Hints, and Review Triggers from the
   existing intent view.
3. Add deterministic review triggers for missing belongs-here signals, missing
   hard limits/avoid rules, empty starter-template selection, and helpful-only
   policies.
4. Render the summary through `PolicyIntentSummaryCard.vue` before starter
   template details.
5. Keep the summary prop-only and event-free so it cannot mutate policy state.

The second implemented component moves starter-template mechanics behind
intent-first disclosure:

1. Add `PolicyStarterTemplateMechanics.vue` as the wrapper for template
   selection, selected-template details, and combined-signal display.
2. Keep the disclosure forced open when no starter template is selected so new
   policies remain actionable.
3. Collapse the disclosure by default when starter templates already exist so
   operators see policy behavior and intent editing first.
4. Pass search/category state through component `v-model` events and pass all
   template edit commands through explicit events.
5. Keep legacy template attachments and signal details available for power
   users without reintroducing direct `customSignals` mutation paths.

## Research Inputs

- [Vue Props](https://vuejs.org/guide/components/props.html) and
  [Component Events](https://vuejs.org/guide/components/events.html): parent
  state should flow through props and user actions should flow through explicit
  events. The summary card intentionally has no events.
- [Vue Computed Properties](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/computed.html):
  derived UI state should be declarative and cached. The modal computes the
  summary from the existing draft view instead of hand-mutating display state.
- [Vue Composables](https://vuejs.org/guide/reusability/composables.html):
  related stateful concerns should be isolated as the UI grows. The summary
  depends on the existing draft/view utilities instead of adding modal-local
  policy interpretation.
- [OWASP Input Validation Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Input_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.html):
  structured input should use positive validation and expected fields. The
  summary builder only reads known intent buckets and known value keys.

## Recommendation Stack

- Keep product-facing summaries derived from the intent draft, not directly
  from raw preset JSON.
- Keep summary generation pure and deterministic.
- Keep display components prop-only unless they own a real edit interaction.
- Treat review triggers as product-owned checks, not AI-generated copy.
- Keep legacy starter-template details available, but make policy behavior the
  first concept operators see.

Pros:

- Low risk because save payloads do not change.
- Gives users a clearer explanation of policy behavior.
- Creates a clean place for later warning and provenance work.
- Helps expose weak policies before classification.

Cons:

- The summary is still derived from compatibility storage until native intent
  persistence exists.
- Review triggers are intentionally coarse in this first slice.
- Template details remain visible until later Phase 3 disclosure work moves
  them behind an advanced/debug path.

## Validation

Added tests in `client/src/__tests__/utils/policyIntentSummary.test.js`
covering:

- product-facing section generation,
- value formatting for identity, hard-limit, exclusion, compatibility, and
  booster signals,
- deterministic review triggers for weak intent.

Added tests in `client/src/__tests__/PolicyIntentSummaryCard.test.js`
covering:

- read-only section rendering,
- complete versus needs-review status,
- empty-section copy,
- review-trigger rendering.

Added tests in `client/src/__tests__/PolicyStarterTemplateMechanics.test.js`
covering:

- forced-open rendering when no starter template is selected,
- default-collapsed rendering when starter templates already exist,
- browser search/category/add-all/toggle event pass-through.

Focused validation:

```bash
npm --prefix client run test -- PolicyIntentSummaryCard.test.js policyIntentSummary.test.js PolicyBuilderModal.test.js PolicyIntentEditor.test.js
```

Starter-template disclosure validation:

```bash
npm --prefix client run test -- PolicyStarterTemplateMechanics.test.js PolicyBuilderModal.test.js PolicyStarterTemplateBrowser.test.js PolicySelectedStarterTemplates.test.js PolicyIntentSummaryCard.test.js
```
