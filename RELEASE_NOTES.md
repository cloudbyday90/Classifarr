## v0.37.0-alpha

## 🎯 Overview

**Revolutionary Classification Redesign:** v0.37.0 shifts from "AI decides" to "Formula calculates + AI validates"

This release fundamentally reimagines classification to be:
- **Transparent** - Users see exactly why each item was classified
- **Configurable** - Adjust weights for presets, patterns, RAG, and history
- **Efficient** - AI only validates, doesn't make primary decisions (70-80% cost reduction)
- **Explainable** - Full breakdown of classification reasoning
- **Learning** - System improves from every user decision

---

## 🚀 Major Features

### Policy-Driven Classification Engine
The new Policy Engine replaces rule-based scoring with a hybrid policy system:
- **Presets**: 168 pre-built content type definitions (genres, ratings, themes)
- **Patterns**: Auto-discovered studio, collection, and keyword associations
- **RAG**: Embedding-based similarity matching
- **History**: Learning from past decisions and corrections

**How It Works:**
```
Item Arrives → Check Authoritative Signals (100% match)
            → Evaluate All Policies
            → Score: Presets + Patterns + RAG + History
            → Apply Weights → Rank Results
            → Determine Action (auto/prompt/manual)
```

### AI Skip Logic - 70-80% Faster Classifications
Classifarr now **skips expensive AI calls** when the PolicyEngine is confident:

- **≥85% confidence** → Auto-classify immediately (no AI call)
- **60-84% confidence** → Prompt user via Discord (no AI call)
- **<60% confidence** → Use AI to help choose (existing behavior)

**Benefits:**
- ⚡ **2-5 second latency improvement** per classification
- 💰 **70-80% reduction in AI API costs**
- 🎯 **More consistent results** from deterministic rules
- 📊 **Transparent scoring** - see full PolicyEngine breakdown

**Example:**
```
Before: PolicyEngine (300ms) → AI Verification (3s) = 3.3s total
After:  PolicyEngine (300ms) → Auto-classify = 0.3s total
```

### 168 Content Presets
Pre-built signal definitions organized into categories:
- **Genres** (35): Action, Comedy, Horror, Documentary, etc.
- **Ratings** (12): Family-friendly, Teen, Mature content
- **Themes** (28): Superhero, True Crime, Sports, Holiday, etc.
- **Studios** (18): Major studio content profiles
- **Eras** (8): Classic, Vintage, Modern, Contemporary
- **Languages** (15): Regional content definitions
- **Special** (52): Anime, Reality TV, Standup, etc.

### Event Detection Migrated to PolicyEngine
Event types are now handled by PolicyEngine presets instead of hardcoded logic:

**6 New Event Presets:**
- 🎄 **Holiday & Seasonal** - Christmas, Halloween, seasonal content
- 🏈 **Sports & Athletics** - NFL, NBA, Olympics, sports docs
- 🥊 **PPV & Combat Sports** - UFC, MMA, boxing, wrestling
- 🎵 **Concert & Live Music** - Concerts, festivals, live performances
- 🎤 **Stand-up Comedy** - Comedy specials and stand-up
- 🏆 **Awards & Ceremonies** - Oscars, Emmys, award shows

**Benefits:**
- ✅ **Unified system** - Events use same flow as all content
- ⚙️ **Configurable** - Adjust keywords, weights via UI
- 🔧 **Extensible** - Easy to add new event types
- 📈 **Better accuracy** - Can combine with other signals

### Feedback & Learning Loop
Every classification decision feeds back into the system:
- **Feedback Capture**: Full metadata, signals, user reason
- **Pattern Discovery**: Auto-detect recurring studios, keywords
- **Tuning Suggestions**: AI-generated policy improvements
- **Accuracy Tracking**: Before/after metrics for changes

### Enhanced Prompts
Context-rich prompts that explain uncertainty:
- Low confidence breakdown (✅ matching, ⚠️ conflicting, ❓ unknown)
- Close race comparisons
- New discovery handling (unknown studios)
- Pattern learning options ("Remember: A24 → Indie")

- `promptBuilder.js` - Enhanced prompt generation
- `legacyMigration.js` - Rule migration service

### Scoring Formula
```
Final Score = (Preset × 0.40) + (Pattern × 0.25) + (RAG × 0.20) + (History × 0.15)
Maximum: 95% (100% reserved for authoritative signals)
```

## 📈 Migration Guide

### From v0.36.x
1. Run database migrations (9 new tables)
2. Content presets auto-seed on first start
3. Existing libraries get default policies
4. Use Migration Wizard for custom rules
5. Migrate event detection to seasonal/genre presets
6. Review and tune policy thresholds

### Recommended Steps
1. Start with default presets
2. Monitor Stats Dashboard for accuracy
3. Apply suggested tunings
4. Migrate legacy rules gradually
5. Convert event detection libraries to seasonal presets

---

## 🐛 Known Issues

- RAG scoring requires embedding service (graceful fallback if unavailable)
- First classification after restart may be slower (cache warming)
